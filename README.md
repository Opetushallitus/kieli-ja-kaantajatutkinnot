docker-compose -f <service-docker-compose-file-name.yml> up
```

In case of errors, clean cache and recreate volumes:

```sh
docker-compose -f <service-docker-compose-file-name.yml> down
docker-compose -f <service-docker-compose-file-name.yml> up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes
```

After starting the services, the frontend runs on > <http://localhost:4000>
