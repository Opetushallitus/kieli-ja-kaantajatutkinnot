  "common.examLevel.description.a1": "Understands in slow and clear speech simple basic expressions that are directly related to the learnerâ€™s own life or concern the immediate concrete environment. Is able to retrieve information from simple, short texts. Copes with the very simplest speech situations, but speech is slow and very disjointed, with possibly defective pronunciation and/or language skills. Is capable of writing extremely short texts that contain numerous linguistic defects.",
  "common.examLevel.description.a2": "Understands clear and simplified speech dealing with everyday, familiar matters. Understands with ease short, simple messages and gets the gist of texts dealing with everyday topics. Copes with routine speech situations requiring simple exchanges of information, even though pronunciation or general language skills may still be defective. Is capable of writing concise, simple texts about everyday matters, but the text may be fragmented.",
  "common.examLevel.description.b1": "Understands longer stretches of speech and the central idea from many TV and radio programmes if the topic area is relatively familiar and the speech tempo is normal. Understands ordinary everyday texts but more demanding texts with unfamiliar subject matter may cause difficulties. Can cope in the most common speech situations and is able to write simple, coherent text on everyday topics, even though grammatical and lexical inaccuracies may occasionally hinder comprehension.",
  "common.examLevel.description.b2": "Understands normal tempo speech on general topics, but some details may not be understood. Fast spoken language and dialects, however, cause difficulties. Has no difficulty understanding texts dealing with general topics, although some nuances conveyed in the text may not be clear. Copes fairly well in a variety of both official and unofficial speech situations. Is able to write both private and semi-official texts and to express thoughts as a coherent whole.",
  "common.examLevel.description.c1": "Understands all kinds of speech at a normal tempo, even though comprehension sometimes requires a certain amount of effort if the subject matter or the way it is handled is unfamiliar. Understands structurally and linguistically complex texts and contemporary literature. Speaks and writes clearly and fluently on various topics, but the use of less common vocabulary and complex sentence structures may, however, cause difficulties.",
  "common.examLevel.description.c2": "Understands a wide range of spoken and written language without difficulty. Experiences only occasional difficulties with subtle differences of tone and nuance in expressions. Speaks and writes extremely fluently in a contextually appropriate style, and is able to express even subtle nuances of meaning. Has a solid command of grammar and vocabulary in almost all situations; even small inaccuracies are rare.",
