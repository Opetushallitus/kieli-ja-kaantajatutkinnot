## General guidelines

- Each interactive element should have an accessible and understandable name
- Use native html elements where possible as they have keyboard access and accessibility already built-in. E.g. `<button />`, `<header />`, `<main />`
- Do not sprinkle aria on components just in case, refer to ARIA implementation guide and specification when in doubt. No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
- In addition to screen reader, check that content can also be accessed via keyboard

## Usability considerations

- `disabled`property and state on components (e.g. input fields, buttons) should only be used in relation to async task(s) (e.g. network request) to signal an on-going transaction. E.g. avoid using disabled input fields, display the value as plain text instead
